## Priotisation
### User Story Map
I decided to prioritize features by listing out potential requirements for a task manager, considering the user personas of those who might need one. I determined that an app focusing on simple task management for people who want to track chores or important dates would be my Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

I outlined these potential features in a user story map. Then, using the MOSCOW method, I decided which features would be included in the initial release for the MVP, which would come next, and which would be developed later.

### MOSCOW
The MOSCOW framework helped me categorize features into Now, Next, and Later, allowing me to focus on what needs to be built for the initial release. NEXT and LATER stage inititives may change based on user feedback.

#### First release (NOW)
The first release primarily consists of must-have and should-have features. The core focus is on building a foundational task management system with essential user authentication. Additional functionalities can be explored in subsequent releases based on user feedback and project priorities.

#### NEXT
The subsequent development phase should concentrate on refining the user experience and enhancing task management capabilities. Key areas include
* User Account Management: Implementing robust forgot password and reset password functionalities
* Task Verification: Incorporating a task confirmation process to ensure users are confirming details before adding or editting.
* Providing basic analytics, such as task status counts, to offer insights into task progress


#### LATER
The later phase of development should prioritize features related to user management, task collaboration, and advanced task management capabilities. Key areas include:
**User Management**
* Multiple sign-in options (Google, Facebook, Task Manager)
* Enhanced security features (2FA, account closure)
**Task Collaboration**
* Task assignment to multiple users
* Ability to select from previous task names
**Advanced Task Management**
* Color-coding tasks for prioritization
* Setting end dates and task durations
* Advanced notifications and reminders
* Task filtering and viewing options
